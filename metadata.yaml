description: Published in 1908, The Fifth Queen Crowned concludes Ford's trilogy about
  Katherine Howard, the fifth wife of Henry VIII; it was preceded by The Fifth Queen
  (1906) and Privy Seal (1907). Ford portrays Howard as a sympathetic figure, a strong-willed
  young woman unafraid to risk her life for the salvation of her husband's soul.
